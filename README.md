# More Objects Mod
Toolkit and resources for SM64DS for some custom objects.

## Installation

Inside this repository is a `commands.sm64ds` file which can be used with SM64DSe-Ultimate to insert, compile assets and dynamics libraries.

## Using Dynamics libaries

You need to download this repository to your computer. And have installed the latest version of [SM64DSe-Ultimate](https://github.com/Gota7/SM64DSe-Ultimate).

Inside the editor go to `More -> Import Patch` and select the `refactorTest.sp2` file from this repository.
Repeat the process once it finishes with `CompileTest.sp2`.

> ⚠️ The file `Code/include/List/FileList.h` and `Code/include/List/SoundList.h` are **generated** by the Editor when using the CompileTest.sp2 script.

> 🚨 The `SM64DSe/objectdb.xml` is **not** updated therefore **cannot** be used.

## How It Works
MOM works from two code segments: the overlay, and the housekeeper.

The custom overlay contains all the code for custom objects in an unused section of RAM, and modifies the object and actor tables of the game to allow for custom objects.

The housekeeper hacks the original game's code to allow for loading the MOM overlay, and for using hooks and replacements to allow for cool game mechanics such as 2D levels.
